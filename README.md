PKGBUILDs for Virbos32

# Packages Built:
- ninvaders: building fine on `pentium4`.. `i686` untested
- yay: works fine on `pentium4`
- vscodium32: works fine on `pentium4`.. `i686` may/may not work as it depends on sse2(binary bruh)
- `alacritty-sixel` yay it works

# Packages Dropped:

- vscodium(upsteam): electron itself does not support i686(use `vscodium32` if you are on `i686`)

- nvm: dependency of vscodium
- vscodium-marketplace: vscodium itself is unsupported
